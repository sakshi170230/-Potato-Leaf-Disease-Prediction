# Potato Leaf Disease Detection
This project is focused on identifying different types of diseases in potato leaves using deep learning techniques. By leveraging models like CNN, RNN, and a hybrid CNN-RNN architecture, the goal is to help farmers and researchers detect diseases early and accurately, improving crop yield and health.

## 🔍 What This Project Includes

Here are the main files you'll find in this repository:

- `potato-disease classification.ipynb` – A complete notebook using a CNN model to classify diseased vs healthy potato leaves.
- `cnn-rnn .ipynb` – A hybrid model that first extracts features using CNN and then uses RNN for sequence-based learning.
- `potato-disease classification cnn.ipynb` – An alternate version of the CNN model with a different approach to training and preprocessing.
- `potato-disease-classification  rnn.ipynb` – A notebook using only RNN architecture for classification.

## 🧠 About the Models

- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)** – Used for extracting spatial features from images.
- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)** – Explores sequence-level patterns from features.
- **CNN-RNN Hybrid** – Combines CNN's spatial power with RNN's sequence modeling.
